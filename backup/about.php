                <h2> Ahead was created @ Codeday SF 2014. The purpose of the app was to help users get ahead in their life and continuosly progress. We found that the best way to gain progress is by creating and following through with goals that you set. Our system simply allows you to set goals and the system will remind you about your goal. </h2>
